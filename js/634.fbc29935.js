A two-stream analytical solution, as well as a budget analysis based on Monte-Carlo simulations, are used to offer a physical explanation of such influence on an idealized isothermal atmosphere by cloud scattering: it increases the chance of photons being absorbed by the atmosphere before they can reach the boundaries (both top and bottom), which leads to a reduction of TOA upwelling radiance. Actual sounding profiles and cloud properties inferred from satellite observations within six-hour timeframes are fed into a more realistic and comprehensive radiative transfer model to show such cloud scattering effect, under nearly isothermal circumstances in the lower troposphere, can lead to ~1 to 1.5 K decrease in brightness temperature for the nadir-view MODIS 8.5-μm channel.

We incorporated this mechanism into a climate model and ran pairs of simulations, with or without cloud scattering, to see how it would affect the simulated global climate. We found that cloud longwave scattering reduces the longwave radiation that goes to space. Such reduction of outgoing longwave radiation is strongest in the tropics.

Two MODIS surface products were examined: one relying on generalized split-window algorithm while assuming emissivities from land cover classifications (MYD11A2), the other based on Temperature Emissivity Separation algorithm capable of dynamically retrieving emissivities (MYD21A2). Both products suggest that, compared to adjacent regions without changes before and after solar farm constructions, the solar farm sites have reduced outgoing radiances in three MODIS infrared window channels. Such reduction in upward longwave radiation is consistent with previous in situ measurements. The MYD11A2 results show constant emissivities before and after solar farm constructions because its land type classification algorithm is not aware of the presence of solar farms. The estimated daytime and nighttime LST reduction due to solar farm deployment are ∼1–4K and ∼0.2–0.9K, respectively. The MYD21A2 results indicate a decrease in Band 31 (10.78–11.28 μm) emissivity up to −0.01 and little change in Band 32 (11.77–12.27 μm) emissivity. The LST decreases in the MYD21A2 is slightly smaller than its counterpart in the MYD11A2. Laboratory and in situ measurements indicate the longwave emissivity of solar panels can be as low as 0.83, considerably smaller than MODIS retrieved surface emissivity over the solar farm sites. The contribution of exposed and shaded ground within the solar farm to the upward longwave radiation needs to be considered to fully explain the results.

Our case study using one solar farm indicates a 20%–25% reduction of surface reflectance over the seven MODIS bands due to the solar panel installation. Radiative transfer calculation shows that such a reduction in surface spectral reflectance leads to a ∼23% decrease in the upward shortwave broadband flux at the surface and a ∼14%–18% decrease in the clear-sky reflected shortwave flux at the top of atmosphere (TOA). Though the MODIS surface reflectance retrievals can be affected by other factors such as aerosol or thin-cirrus contaminations, five out of six solar farm sites analyzed here show unambiguously detectable changes of surface reflectances due to solar panel installations.

For example, most climate models assume purely absorptive clouds and surfaces in the LW. When cloud LW scattering is ignored, outgoing LW radiation is overestimated by 1.1 W/m<sup>2</sup> on global average, resulting in a cold bias in global-mean surface temperature of ~0.6 K. When surface emissivity is assumed unity, the surface temperature is further underestimated by ~0.5 K, especially over deserts with relatively low surface emissivity.

Such modeling studies lack long-term observational constraints and do not consider complex atmosphere-panel-surface interactions. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) aboard the NASA Aqua satellite, we have quantified the change of surface spectral reflectances, spectral emissivities, and land surface temperature over six solar farms commissioned in the southwestern U.S. Results suggest a 20-25% reduction of surface reflectance over the seven MODIS shortwave bands due to the solar panel installation, leading to a ~23% decrease in the surface upward shortwave broadband flux and a ~14-18% decrease in the clear-sky reflected shortwave flux at the top of the atmosphere. Despite the uncertainty and disagreement in current surface retrieval algorithms, results show that the outgoing longwave radiances over the MODIS infrared window channels are reduced. Based on these observations, we will implement a more realistic representation of solar farms in global climate models. Specifically, we will put a translational layer in the Community Terrestrial System Model, the land component in CESM. This layer will modify the radiative and momentum fluxes given solar panels’ geometrical and radiative properties on top of the natural surfaces. The new scheme can output panel temperature to be compared to and explain in-situ and satellite observations. It will help us understand the potential impact on the climate system if an increasing number of solar farms are deployed in the future.","sectionId":"AS22","sectionName":"Understanding and Modeling Climate Impacts of Anthropogenic Land Use Change","attachments":[]},{"abstractId":"AS17-A001","abstractTitle":"The Insights from Twenty Years of AIRS Radiances and an Outlook for the Incoming Decade: A Climate Perspective","abstractAuthors":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Xianglei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiuhong"},{"family":"Strow","given":"Larrabee"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Chongxing"},{"family":"Loeb","given":"Norman"},{"family":"Kato","given":"Seiji"},{"family":"Yue","given":"Qing"}],"abstractType":"Oral","abstractBody":"Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard the NASA Aqua satellite has been operating since September 2002.

First, the trends of global-mean, nadir-view, and clear-sky radiances from two decades of AIRS observations are studied, together with the counterparts of synthetic radiances based on two reanalyses, ECMWF ERA5 and NASA GEOS V5.4.1. The AIRS observation shows statistically significant negative trends in most of its CO2 channels, positive but non-significant trends in the channels over the window regions, and statistically significant positive trends in some of its H2O channels. The best agreements between observed and reanalysis radiance trends are seen over the CO2 tropospheric channels, while the trends over the CO2 stratospheric channels are opposite between the observations and reanalyses. ERA5 results largely agree with the AIRS observation over the H2O channels, but this is not the case for GEOS V5.4.1. Second, using ERA5 reanalysis data, other A-Train observations, and greenhouse gas measurements from NOAA, we derived the spectral radiative forcing due to greenhouse gas increases in the last 20 years, and short-term spectral radiative feedbacks of lapse rate, water vapor, and cloud over the same period. The combined spectral radiative forcings and radiative feedbacks agree well with the spectral flux trend derived from the AIRS L3 spectral OLR product. The most significant discrepancies happened in the far-IR region, a spectral region with no actual AIRS coverage (so its spectral flux has to be estimated using the mid-IR spectral flux directly inferred from AIRS radiance observations). The implications of two forthcoming far-IR missions, PREFIRE by NASA and FORUM by ESA, for resolving such far-IR discrepancies are then discussed.","sectionId":"AS17","sectionName":"Application of Satellite Data to Weather, Climate and Environmental Study","attachments":[]}]},{"conferenceName":"Gordon Research Conference on Radiation and Climate","conferenceAbbr":"GRC2023","conferenceStartDate":[2023,7,23],"conferenceEndDate":[2023,7,28],"conferenceLocation":"Lewiston, ME, USA","conferenceLogo":"grc_logo.png","conferenceUrl":"https://www.grc.org/radiation-and-climate-conference/2023/","presentations":[{"abstractId":null,"abstractTitle":"Ice-Cloud Longwave Scattering in Climate Models Leads to More Impacts on Mean-State Climate than Climate Feedbacks","abstractAuthors":[{"family":"Fan","given":"Chongxing"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yi-Hsuan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiuhong"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Wuyin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Xianglei"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ping"}],"abstractType":"Poster","abstractBody":"<p>Climate models often ignore cloud scattering in the longwave (LW) for computational efficiency.

A recent study based on a slab-ocean model simulation shows a strong wintertime surface warming in the polar region due to the inclusion of ice cloud LW scattering effect. This study implemented the cloud LW scattering effect into a fully-coupled climate model, the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) version 2 by DoE and assessed its impact on the simulated global cimate in a more comprehensive way.</p><p>By turning on and off the LW cloud scattering in the modified E3SM v2 model, we studied the cloud LW scattering effect by comparing four pairs of 35-year fully-coupled simulations. The cloud LW scattering warms the entire global troposphere by ~0.4 K in average; the warming is stronger in the Arctic (~0.8 K) than in the tropics. The Arctic wintertime mean surface temperature change caused by the LW cloud scattering can be as large as 2K. Using a double-call procedure (i.e., running an offline radiative transfer calculation as the model integrates), we further decomposed the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and surface downward longwave flux (FLDS) changes to changes due to the instantaneous radiative effect of scattering and changes by the feedback. The instantaneous global-mean OLR reduction due to the LW cloud scattering is 1.0 W/m<sup>2</sup> and is pronounced in the tropics (as much as 2.5 W/m<sup>2</sup>). The instantaneous global-mean FLDS increase is small (<0.1 W/m<sup>2</sup>), indicating that most radiative flux redirected by the scattering is absorbed in the atmosphere. The FLDS increase caused by the feedbacks is much larger, ~2.2 W/m<sup>2</sup> globally and 4~5 W/m<sup>2</sup> in the Arctic, suggesting that the strong surface warming in the Arctic when LW scattering is enabled is primarily driven by the feedback processes. Finally, we analyzed the tropical cloud responses to the inclusion of ice cloud LW scattering. In the tropical middle troposphere, LW scattering leads to a cloud phase shift from ice to liquid, a lift of high clouds in the maritime deep convection region, reduction of anvil cloud coverage, and an increase of tropical marine stratus. These responses are analogous to the typical tropical cloud feedbacks driven by surface warming caused by the increase of greenhouse gases. To the first order, enabling ice cloud LW scattering keeps more longwave radiation in the climate system, similar to what the increase of greenhouse gas does to the climate system. The effect of cloud LW scattering on abrupt 4xCO2 simulation is also discussed.

In this study, we quantified the change of these radiative properties from six solar farms commissioned in the southwestern U.S. Our case study suggests a 20-25% reduction of surface reflectance over the seven MODIS shortwave bands due to the solar panel installation. Such a reduction in surface spectral reflectance leads to a ~23% decrease in the surface upward shortwave broadband flux and a ~14-18% decrease in the clear-sky reflected shortwave flux at the top of the atmosphere. Five out of the six solar farms show unambiguously detectable decreases in surface spectral reflectance.

Such approximation will not hold when the water vapor mixing ratio is low (e.g., upper troposphere and polar regions), particularly over the far-IR dirty window (~350-630 cm<sup>-1</sup>) where the single scattering albedo of ice cloud can be as high as 0.85. A recent study based on a slab-ocean model simulation shows a strong wintertime surface warming in the polar region due to the inclusion of ice cloud LW scattering effect. This study implemented the cloud LW scattering effect into a fully-coupled climate model, the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) version 2 by DoE and assessed its impact on the simulated global climate in a more comprehensive way.</p><p>By turning on and off the LW cloud scattering in the modified E3SM v2 model, we studied the cloud LW scattering effect by comparing four pairs of 35-year fully-coupled simulations. The cloud LW scattering warms the entire global troposphere by ~0.4 K in average; the warming is stronger in the Arctic (~0.8 K) than in the tropics. The Arctic wintertime mean surface temperature change caused by the LW cloud scattering can be as large as 2 K. The tropical cloud responses due to LW scattering are analogous to the typical tropical cloud feedbacks caused by the increase of greenhouse gases. We further decomposed the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and surface downward longwave flux (FLDS) changes to changes due to the instantaneous radiative effect of scattering and changes by the feedback. The instantaneous global-mean OLR reduction due to the LW cloud scattering is 1.0 W/m<sup>2</sup> and is pronounced in the tropics (up to 2.5 W/m<sup>2</sup>). The instantaneous global-mean FLDS increase is small (<0.1 W/m<sup>2</sup>), while the increase caused by the feedbacks is much larger, ~2.2 W/m<sup>2</sup> globally and 4~5 W/m<sup>2</sup> in the Arctic. This suggests that the strong surface warming in the Arctic when LW scattering is enabled is primarily driven by the feedback processes. To the first order, enabling ice cloud LW scattering keeps more longwave radiation in the climate system, similar to what the increase of greenhouse gas does to the climate system. Our study suggests that the cloud LW scattering effect should be included in the coupled climate system for a faithful representation of the radiative process in the atmosphere.</p><a href=\\"https://agu.confex.com/data/abstract/agu/fm22/7/7/Paper_1066477_abstract_963957_0.png\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><img src=\\"https://agu.confex.com/data/abstract/agu/fm22/7/7/Paper_1066477_abstract_963957_0.png\\" title=\\"A53F-04 Abstract Img\\" class=\\"full-width\\"></a>","sectionId":"A53F","sectionName":"General Session: Atmospheric Physics, Radiation, Clouds, and Aerosols III Oral","attachments":[{"label":"Recording","icon":"videocam","url":"https://youtu.be/4cUClUas588"}]}]},{"conferenceName":"Midwest Student Conference on Atmospheric Research","conferenceAbbr":"MSCAR","conferenceStartDate":[2022,10,1],"conferenceEndDate":[2022,10,2],"conferenceLocation":"Urbana, IL","conferenceLogo":"MSCAR_logo.jpeg","conferenceUrl":"https://atmos.illinois.edu/mscar","presentations":[{"abstractId":"#35","abstractTitle":"Satellite-observed changes of surface reflectance, emissivity, and temperature due to solar farming and the implication for radiation budget","abstractAuthors":[{"family":"Fan","given":"Chongxing"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Xianglei"}],"abstractType":"Poster","abstractBody":"<p>Solar farms consist of arrays of solar panels to convert solar energy to electricity.

In such case, cloud longwave scattering is deemed negligible due to strong absorption by clouds and greenhouse gases, which may not be true when absorbers are not abundant. This is especially a concern in the polar regions, where the water vapor concentration is small. Climate models also assume that the surface is a blackbody, and the surface emissivity is thus unity with no spectral variation. However, the real surface emissivity indeed varies with the frequency and can be far below one for some spectral regions and for certain surface types. We loosened both assumptions in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) version 2 to consider the cloud longwave scattering and the surface spectral emissivities. This is done by enabling the radiative transfer solver to use a hybrid two-stream/four-stream method to treat the longwave scattering and surface spectral emissivities. Models with these improvements will simulate a climate with less missing physics, which is beneficial for assessing cloud feedbacks and projecting future climate change.</p><p>Our performance tests show that, compared to the original E3SMv2 model, these modifications add <10% of computational costs. We designed 4 cases to diagnose the cloud scattering effects: one only with the new radiative transfer solver but no scattering and emissivity effects (noScatEmis), one with the scattering effects on (Scat), one with the emissivity effects on (Emis), and one with both options on (Full). We ran 35-year simulations for each case branching from the E3SMv2 preindustrial control (piControl) run and compared them to the counterparts simulated by the original E3SMv2 model. We found that, in general, the model with the new radiative transfer solver simulates a slightly colder climate by ~0.3 K compared to the original model. Cloud longwave scattering contributes to ~0.37 K warming to the global mean surface skin temperature and ~0.42 K warming to the global mean tropospheric temperature, while surface emissivity effect contributes to ~0.52 K warming to the surface temperature and ~0.18 K warming to the tropospheric temperature. Cloud longwave scattering effect warms the upper troposphere more than the lower troposphere by about 30%, while surface emissivity effect warms up the whole tropospheric column uniformly. Linearity holds well as the arithmetic sum of the Scat and Emis case is close to the modeled results in Full. The conversion of cloud ice contents to cloud water contents due to cloud scattering is most noticeable, ~10%, in the mid troposphere.

However, such approximations widely adopted by virtually all the climate models break down in the high-latitude due to small water vapor abundance. Consequently, the surface-atmosphere longwave coupling manifests in high latitudes, with the most noticeable impact in the polar winter. Using the NCAR CESM and DoE E3SM models, we quantitatively show the statistically significant and seasonally dependent impact of such longwave coupling on simulated polar climate and surface energy budget. The effect of surface spectral emissivity and longwave scattering is linearly additive to each other, and the dominant contribution is from the far-IR region.
